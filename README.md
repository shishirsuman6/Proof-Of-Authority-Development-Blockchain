# Proof Of Authority Development Blockchain
This project work covers steps to setup a Private Testnet Blockchain that can be used to explore potentials for what Blockchain Technology can do in Financial Services space. This Testnet would allow developers the freedom of experiment because there is no real money involved, and this custom network is offline.

## Installations
- [MyCrypto](https://www.mycrypto.com/) Desktop App  
MyCrypto is a free, open-source, client-side interface that allows you to interact directly with the blockchain.  
In this project, we will use MyCrypto Desktop App to manage ethereum wallets and make transactions in the blockchain.  
To install MyCrypto Desktop App, please open your browser and navigate to the downloads page at https://download.mycrypto.com/.  
Based on the operatign system, download the installer, open the file, and follow the installation wizard.

- [Go Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/) Tools  
Go Ethereum is one of the three original implementations of the Ethereum protocol. It is written in Go, fully open-source and licensed under the GNU LGPL v3.  
In this project, we will use Go Ethereum Tools to create our very own blockchain, from the genesis block to mining tokens and making transactions.
For installations, we shall use the application executable binary file using the following steps:  
  * Open your browser and navigate to the Go Ethereum Tools download page at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/
  * Scroll down to the "Stable Releases" section and proceed depending on your operating system to install "Geth & Tools 1.9.7".
  * After downloading the tools archive, open your "Downloads" folder, decompress the archive in the location of your preference in your computer's hard drive, and rename the containing folder as `Blockchain-Tools`.
